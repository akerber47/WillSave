Wasting time on websites is hard to avoid. This is a personal productivity tool
to use in place of standard iOS web browsers (Safari, Chrome etc.). Feel free
to clone and run it yourself if you're interested.

It can only open specific hard-coded pages and links from those pages, to
prevent procrastination. Links open with Safari-style navigation controls, but
the main hard-coded pages are fixed, to make it easier to work with large
single-page web apps.

We can all have a happier time online if we try our best!
